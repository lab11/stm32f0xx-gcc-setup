STM32F0XX
==========

This is a template to use the STM32F0xx with GCC and Makefiles.

It currently only runs on linux, and flashes programs with the JLink Segger programmer over SWD.

To use this code:

1) Download the STM [Standard Peripheral Library](http://www.st.com/web/catalog/tools/FM147/CL1794/SC961/SS1743/LN1939)
for the STMF0xx. Place it in a persistent location.

2) Download and install the [JLink tools](https://www.segger.com/jlink-software.html)
for your platform. Make sure that the binaries are added to your path.

3) Edit the application Makefile to specify:

	-your specfic STM32F0xx device

	-the location of the Standard Peripheral Library

	-the location of the makefile template above (if not cloned recursively)

	-any source files that you use

4) Use the supported commands to program and debug the chip:

	-make

	-make debug

	-make flash

	-make erase-all

	-make startdebug
